# SceneKit Framework Overview

**SceneKit** is Apple‚Äôs built-in 3D graphics framework that lets you create interactive scenes and animations ‚Äî **without writing low-level graphics code**.  
It‚Äôs designed for developers who want to build rich 3D content using a high-level, descriptive API.

With SceneKit, you can easily add:
- üßä 3D objects
- üí° Lights
- üé• Cameras
- üß≤ Physics
- ‚ú® Particle effects

This makes it a powerful tool for building everything from visualizations to immersive games or AR scenes.

## About This Demo App

This is a **simple SceneKit demo** that places a 3D cube in a scene. Users can interact with it using on-screen buttons.

### Features

- **Jump:** Pressing ‚ÄúJump‚Äù gives the cube a boost upwards (gravity pulls it back down).
- **Spin:** Makes the cube rotate continuously.
- **Fun Mode:** Enables random 3D shapes (spheres, cones, pyramids, boxes) to drop around the cube every second.

ÔøΩ Just tap the buttons to see the cube and objects interact in a dynamic 3D world.
